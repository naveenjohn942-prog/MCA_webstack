                <p>Crayon Shin-chan (Japanese: クレヨンしんちゃん, Kureyon Shin-chan, also known as Shin-chan in other countries) is a Japanese manga and anime series written by Yoshito Usui. It has 56 (including the New Crayon Shin-chan series) manga volumes. The anime has been broadcast since 1992, and there are twenty-four movies as of 2016. They are popular all over the world. The anime program Shinchan has more than 900 episodes. This show is broadcasteon Tv Asahi in Japan and on Hungama TV in India.</p>
                 
                 <p>While Shinchan's full first name is 'Shinnosuke' (pronounced 'Shinnoskay') he is also sometimes referred to as 'Shin'. The name 'Shin' is Japanese for 'heart' , while 'chan' is Japanese for 'child'. Although Shinchan is heterosexual he sometimes has homosexual traits.
                </p>
                <p> Shinnosuke Nohara is the young boy on whom the character of a 5 year old Shin Chan is based. Nohara died in a car accident while trying to save his younger sister. After his death, the mother Misae experienced a period of deep misery and she started sketching her lost son.</p>
                <p>He is 5 years old and yet acts overly mature. He knows the adults' words (does not always fully understand the meaning though), and hints at his somewhat deep philosophy in between dumb behavior. In general, he is brutally honest, highly curious, and has no shame whatsoever. Ironically, there have been several instances in which Shinnosuke's own crazy antics actually solved the problems of those around him. Whether this is the result of his own or purely accidental is debatable. Adding to that, he also displays a surprising amount of talent and ability in various activities (running, surfing, kendo, fishing, skiing, swimming and others).</p>
