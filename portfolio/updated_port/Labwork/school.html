                <p>The school is divided into three classes: the Sunflower class, Rose class and Tulip class. The Sunflower class and Rose class are always in competition with each other in activities such as Baseball, Football etc.

                    The school bus is shaped like a cat, and picks up the students every morning. Bunta Takakura drives the bus of the Futaba Kindergarten every day (although in the first episodes of the series we can see another driver totally unknown in the bus). Shin-chan is almost always late. The Japanese regulations require that school buses carry bold colors to warn cars of their presence, hence their shape and colors of a cat.
                    
                    Once a year they celebrate the "sports day", where classes compete in various physical tests.
                    
                    In all secondary schools in Japan students remain in the same classroom all day and eat their lunches together in that same classroom with their teachers. This is also true in Crayon Shin-chan, where the teacher checks to see that everyone has the proper bent√¥ ("box lunch") and the proper tools with which to eat before digging in.</p>
